# FE-linear-dependency
Code for a working paper on linear dependency issues that arise when adjusting 
for sibling fixed effects. There are only two pieces of code needed:

- lindep_functions.R
- lindep_analysis.R

lindep_functions.R contains (not surprisingly) the functions needed to run
the analysis, and lindep_analysis sources those functions and runs them with
specification to perform the analysis. Both files are annotated for ease
of interpretation.

There is also a third file:

- procedural code.R

This file is more messy and was what the code initially looked like when I was
writing it down. It contains more annotation and some thoughts.

This is code I wrote for a joint working paper with:
